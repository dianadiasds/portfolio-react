                Hello. My name is Diana. I am from Brazil and live in Eindhoven in the Netherlands. It's been more than
                10
                years since I graduated from Digital Design. At the beginning of my career, I worked as a
                designer doing creations including for print media. Then I turned my focus to creating online, websites,
                emails
                and apps.

                Over time I have been improving my technical skills to work with web development. I had the opportunity
                to
                develop the frontend of numerous portals and e-commerces and work in agile development teams. Without
                forgetting
                my creative side, I also studied user interface and user experience.

                I learned a lot about site optimization for search and CMS content management in practice. In 2018 I
                completed
                my MBA in Digital Marketing, something that greatly enriched my vision of business as a whole. I'm a fan
                of
                old
                video games, and freehand drawing is my favourite hobby.
